# 1
Golang for Python Programmers
Red Hat

: Ex-Pythonista, Newbie Gopher
: Projects using go - docker,kubernetes,etcd,influxdb
: Purpose of this talk ?
: Share my experience in this journey from python to go
: Introduce Go for people who have programmed in Python
: Invoke interest to explore Go further (know "what" to google)
: Get a head start for people/projects which want to move


#2
* Hello world!
Python code:
.play -edit -numbers code/hello_world.py
Go code:
.play -edit -numbers code/hello_world.go

LPT: Checkout [[https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present]]

: convention in Go is to use MixedCaps or mixedCaps
: init function
: init() is always called, regardless if there's main or not, so if you import a package that has an init function, it will be executed
: Language vs implementation: CPython, PyPy, Jython
: pyc, pyo - bytecode
: Executable commands must always use package main
: Braces instead of ':' + indentation
: Execution begins at main function
: Almost nothing is in-built, unlike Python, example open() function
: " " != ' '
: Python print statement trick to not add '\n'
: Zero values (int, bool, string)
: nil vs NULL

#3
* Type System

Python (dynamically typed):
.play -edit code/type.py /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

Go (statically typed):
.play -edit code/type.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

: types are static - once set variable to a type, you cannot change it
: typing is associated with variable and not the value it refers to
: in go, compiler figures out what type it is from the first value you assign
: type safe (type information is always stored)
: type converstions f := float64(i)
: Unlike in C, in Go assignment between items of different type requires an explicit conversion

#4
* Type System

.play -edit code/type2.py /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/
Go:
.play -edit code/type2.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

: Function arguments types and return values are well defined
: Variable name first, then data type
: Specify multiple vars together (shortened)
: Unit testing and code coverage becomes mandatory


#5
* Functions

- Can return multiple values
- Can be variadic for trailing args
- But no **kwargs
- Can't set default value for args
- Named return values a.k.a naked return

.play -edit code/functions.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

: Structs - export etc
: Arrays
: Use of range to go over slice or a map
: length vs capacity
: Use of make() to create array
: Diff b/w new and make
: new() returns a pointer to a newly allocated zero value of type T.
: make() creates slices, maps, and channels only, and it returns an initialized (not zeroed) value of type T (not *T).
: make([]int, 10, 100)


#6
* Operators

"or" of Python is **||* in Go
"and" of Python is **&&* in Go
i++ is a statement, not an expression
there's no ++i (like Python)

: more like english
: in python, integers are immutable

.play -edit code/op.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

Unlike Python, Go has the **goto* statement
- Goto is not bad
- Continue statement takes LABEL too

: Your CPU only has goto statements
: good for generated code and SMs
: gets you out of nested loops

**Pointers*
- Go has them
- You can dereference
- But no pointer arithmetic

: Pointers excercise


#7
* Operators

There's no **in* operator in Go

.play -edit code/inop.py /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/
Go:
.play -edit code/inop.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

: python is hard to beat in prototyping
: very expressive
: upper case and lower case - export or not


#8
* The curious case of 'switch' statement

[[https://docs.python.org/2/faq/design.html][Why isn't there a switch or case statement in Python?]]

    You can do this easily enough with a sequence of if... elif... elif... else

See [[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0275/][PEP 275]] (Switching on Multiple Values)

In Go:
.play -edit code/switch.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

A case body breaks automatically, unless it ends with a `fallthrough` statement.


#9
* Looping: One 'for' to loop them all

The classic for:
.play -edit code/f1.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/
While loop equivalent using for:
.play -edit code/f2.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/
Infinite:
.play -edit code/f3.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

: Python else part for a loop (not executed if there was a break)
: You won't miss list comprehensions


#10
* Dictionary in Python

.play -edit code/d1.py /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/
Keys can be any immutable type


#11
* Dictionary in Go

    map[KeyType]ValueType

Example:
.play -edit code/d1.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

- **range* in go is like **in* operator of python
- Keys may be of any type that is comparable

: Check existence using OK
: Not thread-safe. Thread-safe version in 1.9


#12
* Sets

No sets in Go, but you can do this:
.code code/sets.go


#14
* Error handling

No try, catch, except in Go
There's a bult-in **error* type, but you can define your own

    func Open(name string) (file *File, err error)

Error handling can get quite verbose and repetitive in Go

.code code/err.go

Go has panic() and recover() methods for handling serious errors

"Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced." - The Zen of Python

: panic() example: indexing a slice out of bounds
: stops execution of the current function and begins unwinding the stack
: A call to recover stops the unwinding and returns the argument passed to panic
: the only code that runs while unwinding is inside deferred functions, recover is only useful inside deferred functions
: One use is to kill single goroutine


#15
* Python's context manager and Golang's defer()

.code code/context.py

Used often in ensuring freeing resource or cleanup

**defer()*

.code code/defer2.go

defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns

.play -edit code/defer.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

: arguments are evaluated immediately
: but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns
: first in, last out (stack)


#16
* Closures

Like Python's lambda functions, Go supports anonymous functions

.play -edit code/closures.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/

: scope of variable in functions

- No built-in decorators like Python


#17
* Concurrency - Goroutines and channels

- Go-routines are user level threads (green threads in Python)
- Multiplexed onto OS threads
- Unlike Python, there's no eventlet.sleep() or yield
- Spawn a goroutine by prefixing **go* to a function call
- Similar to the Unix shell's **&* notation


    go SendDataToServer()

: Go has Mutexes too


#18
* Channels

"Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating" - Rob Pike

- Channels are like Unix pipes but are type-safe
- Supports 3 operations - send, receive and close
- Can have a size (number of values it can buffer)

.image images/channel.png 300 _

: Also used to control throughout
: To synchronize
: Producer-consumer model
: Operates on only one value at a time


#19
* Generator pattern using goroutine + channels

.play -edit code/go.go /START OMIT/,/END OMIT/


#20
* OOP: Object Oriented Programming in Go... without classes, objects and inheritance!



#21
* Interfaces and duck typing

: Interfaces provide abstraction
: Go does not require us to explicitly state that our types implement an interface
: you shouldn't care what type of object you have - just whether or not you can do the action on object
: Convenience of duck typing but with the safety of static checking
: Types can have methods only in same package (no monkeypatching)
: No private, protected etc. Exporting or not is based on name
: No implements
: _ in python, case in go lang
: No constructors
: No monkeypatching is very annoying

.code code/duck.go

Define methods on any type you define
Interfaces are satisfied implicitly
Types and values instead of classes and objects


#22
* Composition over inheritance

No is-a relationship, only has-a a relationship
No inheritance, use struct embedding

.code code/embed.go

#23
* Clean code. Easy deployment

gofmt:
similar to autopep8 in python

    gofmt -w main.go

Go compiler:
- Doesn't throw warnings, but...
- Disallows unused package imports
- Disallows cyclic imports

golint tool:
- Checks for coding style mistakes
- Forces documentation of exported types

Deploying Go programs:
- Static linking
- Single binary, no external dependency


#24
* API Documentation

- Godoc extracts and generates documentation from code comments
- Hosted at godoc.org/<your-go-project-github-repo>
- Very similar to sphinx autodoc in python

Examples:
Python: [[https://libgfapi-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]]
Go: [[https://godoc.org/github.com/prashanthpai/sunrpc]]
